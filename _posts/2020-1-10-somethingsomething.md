One of the best things about the internet is the access to people.

It utters these soft words to us and makes us smile when we are at the bottom of ourselves. I think that it means a lot to see it take shape, especially for those that are not able to recognize it.

You see, these ideas, these thoughts float through our brains in an ephemeral way. There's a lot of different facets where we try to make ourselves take shape and see the things that need to be seen. The lenses that we use are often borrowed from those that we respect and those that earnestly help us to be more than ourselves.

I think that it is important to recognize that.
There is so much more to life than the life through the lenses that we currently have.

In fact, I think that it's important to recognize that we need to take steps forward to really and earnestly see them.

I don't know what it is. I don't even think that it comes in waves, but there are a million different facets that lead us to write the way that we do.

For me, I'm currently in China entirely because of the things that I learned from the internet. It birthed these secrets, these ideas that ultimately led me to find opportunities that I never would have. It taught me lessons that were hidden for centuries behind walled gardens that only the rich in mind and in pocket could enter.

So the lenses that we see grow. We find ourselves becoming larger because of them.

There is a heart that we have that demands that we smile more. That we learn more.

At the end of the day, we need to widen our gaze and learn to love the people around us.

Our lenses may sometimes be different, but we are still the same people looking at the same things.
