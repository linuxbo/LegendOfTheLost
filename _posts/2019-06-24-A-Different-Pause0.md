title: "What's next?"
---

What comes next? It's an important question and one that I do want to work on. I want my words to carry weight in this blog. No images, no vides or no sly attempt to make beautiful UI decisions. This needs to be a repository of my thoughts. The launching pad of something that comes next. Most importantly, it needs to be all me.

Calm. Mediated. Opinions and Decisions.

Let's do some writing and then I'll get started trying to figure out what I'm going to do next.

What is a salient and interesting topic that i'd want to write about today?

"The best way for a society to prepare its young people for leadership in government, industry, or other fields is by instilling in them a sense of cooperation, not competition."

Honestly, I still don't even know what that means, but I think it's an interesting enough topic to get started on.

I'd say that some of the most important things to look at when recognizing who we are and what we are prepared to do is kind of looking at our working environment.

My big reflection here.

I'd say that there are a few touch points that I'd want to hit on, but the biggest one of them all is to recognize that we're very absent minded individuals. It takes a lot to generate a sense of self-worth, a desire to work hard and to keep ourselves accountable to others.
There are a lot of factors that feed into what creates a person. How a person's desire to succeed is so easily distracted by the vagrancies of pokemon games. How a desire to write well completely becomes obfuscated with meaningless adjectives and useless verbage.

People take work. Things take effort. Not all that glitters is gold.

At the end of the day, I still want to instill this sense of progress. Where we take those additional steps forward and refuse to take relax on what makes us me.
Now, that doesn't mean we're never going to relax.

It's just relaxation with a purpose.

The idea is that we pause with intent. I'm reasonably confident that I have a certain degree of self control. How much more aggravated would that be with a Youtube algorithim constantly demanding for our atttention. For products in stores that want to be purchased. Things across the board that demand we pay for them.

Just pause and breathe. Live with a purpose and see what we can do with them.
Smile and keep on pushing forward. That's all I'd say.
