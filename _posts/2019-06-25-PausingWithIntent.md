title: "Breathe"
---
There's this concept where people go around and seemingly say, "This is not my problem."

It's kind of a tough thing to run across, especially as we see it reflected in the things that we care the most about. The people that we care about, the projects that we labor for a long time on and most importantly, the feelings that we have.

I think that it is important to recognize that the things around us are our problems. There's a place where we recognize that we need to sit down, open our hearts and our minds to contributing to a cause that honestly might not even fully succeed.

Outside of that, there's also this implicit understanding that we are not driven by the things that pull at our levers for work or relaxation. We don't allow other people to determine what our problems are or how we intend to solve them. I speak with the royal we here, but there seems to be this fascination behind allowing our problems to be solved by the contribution of money, people or even 'vacations.' I personally reject that thesis and I want to take a couple steps forward to thinking of something else entirely different here.

Learning to breathe is meaningless if we don't need air. Learning to pause is nothing if we have no time.

I want to reestablish what our problems are. What we care about. Who we care about. How we care about.

There are so many things that are incredibly vital phenomena in our lives. We need to address them sincerely in the way that they should be addressed.

We need to breathe. To Pause. To care.

It's on us to determine how.
