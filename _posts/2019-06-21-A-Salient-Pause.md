title: "Pause"

Hi. I’m Linus and I’m twenty-three years old. In some people’s eyes, I’m the crust that they rub out in the morning as they wake up to live their highly successful lives. But in other people's eyes, i’m a boyfriend, an employee, a college graduate, a son and a friend. I can choose to define myself and be defined by so many ways. 


I digress.

I write because I want to write. I love because I want to love. That's why I do these things.

I think the nuance here is now that I need to figure out who we are going forward. There's a lot of vitriol that comes from trying to make sure that other people understand ethnic culture and background. One of the funniest moments I had was my boss asking me if I understood what the wedding toss was during the reception. There's a lot of interesting things that happened and continue to happen and it's kind of up to us to determine what's legitamite and what's not. 

I realize that it's tough. It's really tough. The world outside is kind of cold, dark and for many people just overbearing and overwhelming. 

I simply hope that this provides a little breath of air.
