title: "You make me happy"

"You make me happy."

I think that is such a beautiful phrase.

You know, I don't think I've ever been completely sold on the vision of an organization. Whether it has been church, work or even a non-profit, I don't know if vision is truly what pushes me.

In all honesty, I think that depth and maturity that I display within the organizations I've been part of come from the simple and honest joy of mutual understanding.

I believe that smiles seek hearts that reciprocate.

People yearn to know and feel that, I am beloved.

That there is a melodic hymn that comes from honest joy.

----

There's honesty in the places that we dare not go.
There's joy in things we've never considered.
There are people that have lived lives that we couldn't even imagine.

I write this having come off a wedding with some old college friends. These were and are individuals that I have labored beside.
People that I have demanded love with and been inspired with. People with an earnest passion to care for those that were around me.

We demanded love from each other.

In return, we really did achieve something that is bigger than ourselves.


I wrote earlier that:

It's been three years since I've been back.

I can make new paths, even when tangles of time makes the proceeding that much harder.

I can breathe air back into friendships gone stale. I can replace the stories that were lost with ones of love, happiness and joy.

I can host my friends, spending time, talking and deliberating with my peers.

Just because I'm not in college anymore doesn't mean that I can't embrace change anymore.

--

In all honesty, the words rang true.

I made new paths.
Old friendships were refreshed.
Joy was made.
Homes were built for the two hours that we had.

I was happy. People made me happy.
There was joy once again.

I think that at the end of the day, we needed to recognize that.
So look on up my friends.

There is a new dawn here.
One that demands more than just simple adherence to a doctrine that we may not truly agree with.
This is one of joy and happiness. One that seeks connection and empathy.

One that reminds us to seek joy.
