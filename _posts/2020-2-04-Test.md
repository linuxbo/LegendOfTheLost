title: "The Curse of Time"

It's kind of interesting isn't it.

Sometimes we have too little of it and other times we have too much.

Take today for instance.

I was walking around for nearly two hours, hunting for swimming goggles to little-to-no-avail.
Target. Bust.
Walmart. Bust.
24 HR fitness. Bust.

It's kind of inane how difficult it is to sinmply find a place where I could find goggles.

I was definitely putting myself in quite the huff, trying my utmost to find something that just wouldn't pop up!

I had an appointment at 3pm. I had things to do. I'm a very important person.

Sheeesh. That's all I can say about it.

I gotta get over myself. Got to learn and be better at the things that I'm doing.

Can't just let people have their way with things.

I need to earnestly sit back and learn to laugh when laughing really isn't the best option.
I need to earnestly walk when walking isn't the best option.

Really though. I need to stop taking myself so seriously.

There's a whole world of things that require things out of us and we can't just let it go willy nilly.

It's not that easy isn't it.
