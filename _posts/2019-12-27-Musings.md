What are my values?

It can take time to discern what they are. Who are we and what do we try to do.

One of the things that I've been thinking about lately.

So it takes time to do a lot of things. I think that it's important to recognize that.
Things don't just happen in a flash. They require ideas, hard work and execution. I think my time at Veeva taught me that you needed an eye for quality and execution. I think my time at Bytedance is teaching me the importance of timing, competition and a good onboarding experience.

So I think for me personally, that needs to be the next step forward that I'm planning to take. It's about learning how to facilitate a conversation that is dedicated in a way to a good onboarding experience.

Right now, there seems to be a lot of things that mix and mingle and cogitate in my head.

However, at the end of the day, it needs to be the watchwords that I can at least put myself behind.

Paul Graham has a list of articles detailing who he was and what he did, even starting from a very early age.

I think that this should serve as a similar repositiory.

So let's take a breath and see where this goes.
