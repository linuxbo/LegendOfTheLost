There’s a voice that often whispers in our sad infantile heads, “you’re not going to succeed.”

Tristan set his withered arm down on the porcelain throne, his head pounding from overuse. It had taken him two long years to reach where he was now. A smile here, an outstretched arm there and a whole bunch of flattery to make it to the point where he could finally rest in peace. Yet, the responsibilities seemed to weigh all the much more where he was now. 

You see, sometimes the pursuit of power is significantly more attractive when you’re pursuing it than when you have it. It’s the burden of power that weighs so much more. 

“Mylord, we’ve received information that an other-worlder has been summoned by the Rives Nation.” the sycophant continued, “Our wizards were alerted by the systems that you had set up for the magical transitory flash when crossing borders.”

Tristan mulled over the news, his left hand massaging his poor-ole’ burdened neck. He could feel the pressing nature of it as he contemplated his own summoning. He’d simply been watching some good ole’ Netfrix when the darkness opened wide and deposited him buck-naked in the middle of the streets. 

“Do we know where the new OutLander was deposited?” Tristan asked, his mouth quirking into a grin as he intentionally emphasized the O and the L despite the complete lack of discernment from his entourage. It was the small wins that made the days all that much more worthwhile. 

“The outlander sits on the river Rhine. Our nation’s network of magicians after your guidance are remarkably more consistent and accurate after your tutelage.” He said. 

“Well then, are we planning to do anything about it?” Tristan asked.

“We’ve dispatched a pair of knights to intercept and incapacitate this future threat to your radiance.” The sycophant proudly said, his eyes gleaming in confidence of a job well done. 

Poor fool. 

“Hahahahaha….” Tristan audibly and pathetically laughed. You teach a group of people for years the importance of cunning and they learn a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y nothing. “Do we have anyway of contacting these knights?” Tristan asked, hoping to hear the words, “Of course sir! We presumed that your preferences might have differed from our own and had the forethought to add in some ‘wiggle-room.’”

Sadly, no one in the room had thought of that. 

“Of course not sir! We anticipated that speed was of the highest essence. The knights are riding at the highest speed they possibly can, doing their utmost to carry out your wishes as best they can. We presumed that the network you had set up was to eliminate any potential usurpers to your throne!” the messenger said, his chest thrust out. 

“Okay.” Tristan said. He was feeling a little Minnesotan. A little blue, a lot passive aggressive and very, very cold because of his environment. “Well, we best try catching up with the OutLander afterwards. I hope he won’t be too negatively inclined that we attempted to slaughter him.”

Kyren stretched. 

There’s often a still and silent voice that generally says nothing at all. That voice was not present within Kyren’s head. It instead said, “WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!”

Kyren yawned. 

“SERIOUSLY. WE’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. WE LITERALLY JUST DIED.” 

Kyren waved at the pair of knights riding towards him at breakneck speed. Their swords glinted and flashed in rays of the sun. 

“WE’RE LITERALLY GOING TO DIE AGAIN.”

“Shh.” Kyren shushed his internal monologue. It surprisingly wasn’t being very helpful. 

He could feel the earth shaking rhythmically to the force of the incredibly large horses as they rode towards him. People never appreciated how large a horse is until it was galloping at them with literally breakneck speeds. 

He was surprised how calm he felt. It had been literally fifteen minutes since he’d been deposited in this world, but he knew enough about the Terra to be prepared for an encounter very similar to this. 

He held his hands out, gestured towards the knights and flicked his wrists, almost like Spider-high man or the fantasy equivalent, arachna-person. Flames spit out from underneath his wrists, almost like that of a Starcraft Firebat except with a much higher base-heat and a much more satisfying sound. 

The horses were bathed in fire. As living and breathing creatures, they very much did not prefer this change in environment and immediately broke their gallop, flinging their riders high into the air. 

Kyren grinned. Terra wasn’t at all different from what he’d expected it to be. One of the crucial things that apparently God had forgotten to check was the stat values of the game. 

Most characters started at: Strength – 1
Dexterity – 1
Intelligence – 1
Luck – 0

He was at an order of magnitude stronger than the typical beginning adventurer. The flames, well that was just a special secret. One that Kyren had discovered while playing the game a long long time ago. It was an easter-egg left in by an enterprising programmer a long long time ago. 

This served to validate and affirm two things. One, that Legends of the Lost didn’t behave at all like the real world. In fact, this living breathing world still adhered to some of the game mechanics built by humans for a virtual world. Two. That his in-game knowledge would transfer over swimmingly. 

The knights, their armor red from the flames slumped over on the ground. The flames quickly puttered out. Kyren stalked towards the bodies, his own un-clothed body could feel the warmth reflected from the heat of his own spell. Two major pre-requisites for that Flame Gout had been that the character needed to be both unclothed and unclassed. It was also a one-time use ability. 

“YOU JUST KILLED A PERSON.”

Kyren frowned. These bodies weren’t disappearing like they would have in-game. In fact, they simply lay there, the odd singed smell of cooked flesh wafting in the air towards him.

“Oh shit.” He said, his hand moving to cover his mouth. He hadn’t anticipated real-death to be a factor.  “Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.” He said, his head shaking as he started to panic.

The bodies started fading away. Their essences wisped into the air, leaving behind a very conveniently placed pouch in their place. 

“Oh thank God.” Kyren sighed, wiping his sweaty forehead with relief. It was so much more real than anything else, but it seemed that the world adhered to the rules that he still expected. He crouched next to the pouch and opened it. 

An in-game screen appeared:

– Would you like to open the bag? – 

He opened it. 


Knight Outfit – 1x
Gold – 1x
Sword – 1x 

It was oddly less detailed than Kyren had initially anticipated. The Knight Outfit  like an oddly broad description for what it necessitated. Gold and Sword also seemed purposely… ambigious. Legend of the Lost was known for the complex systems and these items were certainly not complex. 

He selected the Knight Outfit and equipped it. 

“Ker-thunk.” 

The armor made an audible noise as it marerialized in mid-air, clad all around his body. It chafed. A lot. 

-Unequip-

“Ker-whoop”

Yeah, he’d need to find some other clothing. Right now Kyren was going to stick with his MFA outfit.  

“whoomph.”

It was time to start walking into the sun. Not at all sure what was going to happen, but an adventure awaited him nonetheless.

Tristan wryly smiled, watching Kyren from the distance. Seemed like the new OutLander had his head on his shoulders. He’d let him rest for awhile. Rive wasn’t the worst place to start. He’d had to start in the Empire of Khusa. That was definitely not the best experience. Nazarick. Now that was an entirely different story.
